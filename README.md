# Leveraging Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics in Product Delivery Timeliness
For organizations of e-business, an efficient shipping system and on-time delivery are essential components which significantly influence customer satisfaction and customer relationship management. This project makes analysis based on a variety of factors which have potential impact on on-time delivery, ranging from warehouse block location, shipment modes, to product costs and importance level of product. By leveraging the dataset, this project develops robust predictive models to forecast the order delivery. In this project, several machine learning algorithms were applied to explore the classification and regression of data, including Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression, as well as some other advanced algorithms like Support Vector Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier and Stacking Classifier. By comparing the accuracy by F1 Score which indicates precision and recall, we can see that the AdaBoost Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier hold the highest accuracy of seventy percent when predicting on-time delivery rate, which helps to provide insights for e-commerce logistics improvement and enhances customer satisfaction.
